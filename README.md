# NLP Sentiment Extraction Challenge
This is Richardson Team's repo for the Kaggle Competition

Once the challenge is over, this notebook will be public for people's reference

**UPDATE June 9: I have created an Archive folder in case you want to move files there. The final version to train or load a model is called Template_SingleM.ipynb; it includes JaccardScore and script to submit the file. Currently working on a Jupyter Notebook version without the Colab setup for Kaggle; details TBA. TEAM UPDATE: Our team in Kaggle is called "The Geese" :)**

UPDATE June 6: We are no longer working in workstreams. We will create models out of a template. More details TBA
